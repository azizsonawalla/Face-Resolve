# Face-Resolve
Uses face-detection to dynamically crop, resize and batch-process large amounts of headshot images

This repository contains some initial algorithms and scratch-work that eventually evolved into the final Face Resolve app here: www.faceresolve.com

The complete Face Resolve app, including the GUI code, cannot be shared under open source since licenses to the software will be sold to individuals/organizations. 

Please feel free to check out my other open source projects, and see www.faceresolve.com for updated versions of the Face Resolve app
